# Zentale

An Android App that turns toy photos into educational stories for adults and kids with the help of Gemini AI. 

This app was built for the [Gemini API Developer Competition](https://ai.google.dev/competition/).

### How it works

1. The user takes a photo of a toy or adds a photo from the gallery.
   * The user can choose a language for the story from English, Spanish, and Romanian.
2. The app uploads the photo to Firebase Storage and gets a public URL.
3. The app sends the public URL to the Zentale API.
4. The Zentale API returns a success message and the story is saved by BE in Firestore.
5. The app fetches the story from Firestore and displays it.

## Screens

### Login
The app uses Google Sign-In to authenticate the user by using One Tap Sign In.

### Home
The Home screen shows a list of demo stories that the user can choose from.

### Library
The Library screen shows a list of private stories ( stories generated by the user ) that the user can choose from.

### Create Story
The Create Story screen allows the user to take a photo of a toy or add a photo from gallery, choose a language for the story, and send it to the Zentale API to generate a story.

### Story
The Story screen shows the stories that the user generated.

### Profile
The Profile screen shows the user's profile information and allows the user to logout.

## Building

## Architecture
This project uses Model-View-ViewModel with Clean Architecture.

## Project Structure
**di** - dependency injection package where we created:

appModule : responsible for some Singleton classes like OkHttp, Retrofit, FirebaseAuth, FirebaseFirestore, FirebaseStorage
domainModule : responsible for domain classes : repositories, managers
dataModule : responsible for datasource
viewModelModule : responsible for view model classes

**domain** - this package is split into several other packages and is the "middle-man" between the presentation layer and the data layer.

* repository ( interface ) : middle class in our domain layer that it is responsible to pass data to the right data source. A mediator in our code.
  Usually, it s the class where we should do most of our business logic.
* model : entities that are sent to our presentation layer.

**data**
* datasource : holds classes related to remote and local work. For example, remote data sources have our api client or firestore classes injected.
* repository ( implementation ) : implementation of our domain inside the data layer, that it is responsible to pass data from and to presentation from data.

**networking** - contains implementation details about our http client and interceptors.
**presentation** - contains a single activity with a navigation component. each screen is represented by a Compose Screen and a ViewModel class. Each viewModels exposes a state MutableStateFlow and/or event SharedFlow. We try to avoid having any kind of logic inside our fragments and everything is passed onto our viewModel which then decides what to do with the data.

## Things TODO:
* Modularization.
* Add text to image conversion when a story is created. This could be done by the Gemini API once that will be available again to the public.
* Add text to voice conversion. I noticed Eleven Labs has a very good API for this, but I'm not sure if it was allowed in the Gemini Competition
* Public library of stories created by the community.
* Add "Did you know?" learnings on story loading. ( This takes time and at least the user can learn something new while waiting )
